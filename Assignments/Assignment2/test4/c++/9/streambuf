   *  @brief  The actual work of input and output (interface).
   *  @ingroup io
   *
   *  @tparam _CharT  Type of character stream.
   *  @tparam _Traits  Traits for character type, defaults to
   *                   char_traits<_CharT>.
   *
   *  This is a base class.  Derived stream buffers each control a
   *  pair of character sequences:  one for input, and one for output.
   *
   *  Section [27.5.1] of the standard describes the requirements and
   *  behavior of stream buffer classes.  That section (three paragraphs)
   *  is reproduced here, for simplicity and accuracy.
   *
   *  -# Stream buffers can impose various constraints on the sequences
   *     they control.  Some constraints are:
   *     - The controlled input sequence can be not readable.
   *     - The controlled output sequence can be not writable.
   *     - The controlled sequences can be associated with the contents of
   *       other representations for character sequences, such as external
   *       files.
   *     - The controlled sequences can support operations @e directly to or
   *       from associated sequences.
   *     - The controlled sequences can impose limitations on how the
   *       program can read characters from a sequence, write characters to
   *       a sequence, put characters back into an input sequence, or alter
   *       the stream position.
   *     .
   *  -# Each sequence is characterized by three pointers which, if non-null,
   *     all point into the same @c charT array object.  The array object
   *     represents, at any moment, a (sub)sequence of characters from the
   *     sequence.  Operations performed on a sequence alter the values
   *     stored in these pointers, perform reads and writes directly to or
   *     from associated sequences, and alter <em>the stream position</em> and
   *     conversion state as needed to maintain this subsequence relationship.
   *     The three pointers are:
   *     - the <em>beginning pointer</em>, or lowest element address in the
   *       array (called @e xbeg here);
   *     - the <em>next pointer</em>, or next element address that is a
   *       current candidate for reading or writing (called @e xnext here);
   *     - the <em>end pointer</em>, or first element address beyond the
   *       end of the array (called @e xend here).
   *
