  /** @defgroup functors Function Objects
   * @ingroup utilities
   *
   *  Function objects, or @e functors, are objects with an @c operator()
   *  defined and accessible.  They can be passed as arguments to algorithm
   *  templates and used in place of a function pointer.  Not only is the
   *  resulting expressiveness of the library increased, but the generated
   *  code can be more efficient than what you might write by hand.  When we
   *  refer to @a functors, then, generally we include function pointers in
   *  the description as well.
   *
   *  Often, functors are only created as temporaries passed to algorithm
   *  calls, rather than being created as named variables.
   *
   *  Two examples taken from the standard itself follow.  To perform a
   *  by-element addition of two vectors @c a and @c b containing @c double,
   *  and put the result in @c a, use
   *  \code
   *  transform (a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), a.begin(), plus<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  To negate every element in @c a, use
   *  \code
   *  transform(a.begin(), a.end(), a.begin(), negate<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  The addition and negation functions will be inlined directly.
   *
   *  The standard functors are derived from structs named @c unary_function
   *  and @c binary_function.  These two classes contain nothing but typedefs,
   *  to aid in generic (template) programming.  If you write your own
   *  functors, you might consider doing the same.
   *
