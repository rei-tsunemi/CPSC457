  // 24.4.1 Reverse iterators
  /**
   *  Bidirectional and random access iterators have corresponding reverse
   *  %iterator adaptors that iterate through the data structure in the
   *  opposite direction.  They have the same signatures as the corresponding
   *  iterators.  The fundamental relation between a reverse %iterator and its
   *  corresponding %iterator @c i is established by the identity:
   *  @code
   *      &*(reverse_iterator(i)) == &*(i - 1)
   *  @endcode
   *
   *  <em>This mapping is dictated by the fact that while there is always a
   *  pointer past the end of an array, there might not be a valid pointer
   *  before the beginning of an array.</em> [24.4.1]/1,2
   *
   *  Reverse iterators can be tricky and surprising at first.  Their
   *  semantics make sense, however, and the trickiness is a side effect of
   *  the requirement that the iterators must be safe.
