   *  @tparam _Key  Type of key objects.
   *  @tparam _Compare  Comparison function object type, defaults to less<_Key>.
   *  @tparam _Alloc  Allocator type, defaults to allocator<_Key>.
   *
   *  Meets the requirements of a <a href="tables.html#65">container</a>, a
   *  <a href="tables.html#66">reversible container</a>, and an
   *  <a href="tables.html#69">associative container</a> (using unique keys).

   *  Sets support bidirectional iterators.
   *
   *  The private tree data is declared exactly the same way for set and
   *  multiset; the distinction is made entirely in how the tree functions are
   *  called (*_unique versus *_equal, same as the standard).
