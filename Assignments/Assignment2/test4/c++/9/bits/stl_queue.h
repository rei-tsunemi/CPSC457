  /**
   *  @brief  A standard container giving FIFO behavior.
   *
   *  @ingroup sequences
   *
   *  @tparam _Tp  Type of element.
   *  @tparam _Sequence  Type of underlying sequence, defaults to deque<_Tp>.
   *
   *  Meets many of the requirements of a
   *  <a href="tables.html#65">container</a>,
   *  but does not define anything to do with iterators.  Very few of the
   *  other standard container interfaces are defined.
   *
   *  This is not a true container, but an @e adaptor.  It holds another
   *  container, and provides a wrapper interface to that container.  The
   *  wrapper is what enforces strict first-in-first-out %queue behavior.
   *
   *  The second template parameter defines the type of the underlying
   *  sequence/container.  It defaults to std::deque, but it can be any type
   *  that supports @c front, @c back, @c push_back, and @c pop_front,
   *  such as std::list or an appropriate user-defined type.
   *
   *  Members not found in @a normal containers are @c container_type,
   *  which is a typedef for the second Sequence parameter, and @c push and
   *  @c pop, which are standard %queue/FIFO operations.
